## Overview
This program is a replacement for the official Akai MPK Mini MkII Editor. Although less fancy, it is just as usable.

## Requirements
The program is written in Python3 and relies on PyQt5 and python-rtmidi. It was tested on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

## Installation
A good way would be to use pip for the dependencies.
### Debian-based distributions
```
  apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip libasound2-dev libjack-dev
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Mac OS X
You can install Python and pip using homebrew. You may need a recent version of Mac OS X.
```
  brew install python3
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows
* Download and install `python3` from [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Make sure you install `pip` as well in the installer wizard
* Download and install [Visual C++ build tools 2015](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)
* In a command prompt, type:
```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Connect your controller, then start the editor with ```./mpk-m2-editor.py```
If you're familiar with the official editor, you should find it's similar, except that programs are grouped in tabs at the top of the window. You can send an individual program or all of them at once. Some fields have tooltips, don't hesitate to hover them.

You can use the scrollwheel to modify any value. If you use it with `CTRL`, the values will change by increments of 10.

The Send RAM button allows you to send the current controller configuration, without overriding any program.

### Joystick
The joystick options work this way:
* First, select the basic behaviour: **Pitchbend**, **CC1** or **CC2**.
* **Pitchbend**: you're done.
* **CC1**: The joystick sends a CC message on the canal specified in **Left** for the X Axis, **Up** for the Y axis.
* **CC2**: The joystick sends a CC message on the canals specified in **Left** OR **Right** for the X Axis, **Up** OR **Down** for the Y axis.

### Auto Fill
Click the menu Edit -> Auto fill... This dialog allows you to fill several fields at once. First tick the check boxes for the options you would like to have filled (eg. PC start). Fill the corresponding fields, and press the button corresponding to the options you'd like to fill (eg. A for Bank A). This will fill the options for the *selected program* tab only.
